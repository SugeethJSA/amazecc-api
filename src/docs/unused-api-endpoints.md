### `vitol-data` — How it works

Scrapes VIT's Moodle instance (Vitol) for upcoming assignments, quizzes, and exams. Uses **separate credentials** (not VTOP):

1. Logs into `https://vitolcc.vit.ac.in/login/index.php` (or alternative site) with username/password
2. Extracts Moodle `sesskey` from the dashboard HTML
3. Fetches current + next month's calendar via Moodle's AJAX API (`core_calendar_get_calendar_monthly_view`)
4. Iterates over each calendar event, visits the event page, and extracts:
   - Course code + name (from breadcrumb)
   - Assignment/quiz name
   - Open date
   - Completion status (whether quiz attempt is finished)
5. Returns `Assignment[]` array

Has a frontend component (`VitolDisplay.tsx`) but it's **commented out** in `ScheduleSubTab.tsx:11-15`, so it's currently unused.
